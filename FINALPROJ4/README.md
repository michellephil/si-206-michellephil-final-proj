Welcome to my project about Cheerios!

For the interactive part of my code please run interactive.py into terminal and follow the link to localhost:500.

There, you will you see there options of links.

The first is a list of all the different flavors of Cheerios. The second is more info about all of the different flavors. This includes Calories, Whole Grain and a description of the product.

The third link is a list of the most 100 recent tweets including the word "Cheerios".
--Code Structure--
My code is structured with the cache and creating the database functions first. Then you will see I created the class Products to store information about the sites products. I used that class to create and store my information into a database. I used tweepy to retrieve the most recent 100 tweets containing the word "Cheerios".

The next file you will find is my test case file in which I tested my code based on the functions and databases I was checking. I then have my interactive.py file which contains all of my python flask to create my localhost:500 site. I have corresponding html sites that store the html for my site.
